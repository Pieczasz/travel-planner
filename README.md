# TraPla - Travel Planner
## Project Descriptoion
This is a travel-themed application that aims to make it simple to plan and 
arranging the trip. We decided on such a project because we think it is
interesting, and the application itself can attract a wide range of users, from people 
who travel frequently, to those who do it occasionally and need support in the organization
due to its usefulness and functionality.

## Authors
We are a group of Polish high school students studying IT technology. We decided to participate in the Hackathon to test our programming skills and see how far we could go as a team. We want not only to test our capabilities, but also to gain valuable experience that will help us in our further development.
